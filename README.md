# MovieList App

---

A simple and responsive movie list application built with **React.js**. This project allows users to search for movies and add them to a personal "Watch List" for later viewing. It showcases basic state management and client-side routing using React.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Movie Search:** Users can type a movie title into an input field and click a button to search for movies.
* **Watch List:** Movies can be added to a dedicated "Watch List" page, preventing duplicates.
* **Navigation:** Seamless navigation between the "Search Movies" page and the "Watch List" page using React Router.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Organized into reusable React components (`App`, `ListMovie`, `WishListPage`) for maintainability.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side routing and navigation between different views.
* **`useState` Hook:** For managing component-level state (e.g., search input, search query, watch list).
* **[Add your CSS Framework/Library, e.g., Tailwind CSS, plain CSS, etc.]**
    *(Based on your `App.css` import, you might be using plain CSS or a custom setup. If you're using Tailwind, mention it here.)*
* **[Movie API you used, e.g., The Movie Database (TMDB) API]**
    *(If you're fetching real movie data, specify the API here. If using dummy data for now, you can omit this or mention "Dummy Data for demonstration".)*

## üíª Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeremyfasollasido/watch-list-website.git
    cd watch-list-website
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **[Optional] Configure API Key:**
    If you're using an external API (like TMDB), you might need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```
    REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    (Replace `REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY` with the actual environment variable name your code uses, and `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your real API key.)

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
